We are pleased to announce the launch of **SIG: Game Intelligence**, a Special Interest Group dedicated to the study, development, and application of intelligent techniques in games and interactive systems.

## Why Game Intelligence?
Games provide a unique and rigorous testbed for artificial intelligence. They combine real-time decision making, long-horizon planning, uncertainty, human interaction, and complex evaluation criteria. At the same time, modern games generate rich data that enable deep analysis of player behavior, engagement, and system design.

Game Intelligence sits at the intersection of:
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning  
- Game Design and Game Engineering  
- Data Analytics and Player Modeling  
- Human–Computer Interaction  

This SIG was formed to create a shared space where these perspectives can meaningfully interact.

## Scope and Interests
SIG: Game Intelligence welcomes discussion and collaboration in areas including (but not limited to):

- Game AI: planning, search, behavior trees, utility AI, reinforcement learning  
- Player modeling and game analytics  
- Procedural content generation (PCG and PCGML)  
- Evaluation methodologies and benchmarking for game agents  
- Tooling, pipelines, and engineering practices for intelligent game systems  

Both theoretical and applied contributions are equally valued.

## What We Do
Our activities will include:
- Reading groups on foundational and recent research
- Technical talks and invited lectures
- Demo sessions and project showcases
- Hands-on workshops and build sessions
- Open discussion on research directions and industry practices

The emphasis is on knowledge sharing, constructive discussion, and practical insight.

## Who Should Join
SIG: Game Intelligence is open to:
- Students interested in game AI and analytics
- Researchers working on AI, ML, or interactive systems
- Industry practitioners building intelligent game systems
- Educators integrating game intelligence into teaching

No single background is required—curiosity and willingness to engage are sufficient.

## Get Involved
If you are interested in joining the SIG, proposing an activity, or contributing resources, please visit the **Join** page on this website. We encourage members to actively shape the direction and activities of the group.

We look forward to building a strong and collaborative community around Game Intelligence.
