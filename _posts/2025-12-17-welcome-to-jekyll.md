Welcome to your new Jekyll-powered website! This is your first blog post.

## Getting Started

Jekyll is a static site generator that transforms your plain text into static websites and blogs. It's perfect for:

- Personal blogs
- Project documentation
- Portfolio sites
- Landing pages

## Writing Posts

To create a new post, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory with the format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md
```

Jekyll will automatically parse the filename to set the post date and title.

## Front Matter

Each post begins with YAML front matter:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +0000
categories: category1 category2
---
```

## Next Steps

- Customize the `_config.yml` file with your site information
- Add more posts to the `_posts` directory
- Modify layouts in the `_layouts` directory
- Add custom styles in the `_sass` directory

Happy blogging!
